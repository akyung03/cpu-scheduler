# CPU Scheduler

This is a CPU scheduling simulation project built with Next.js (or React.js). It simulates several CPU scheduling algorithms and provides visual results.

## Algorithms Implemented
- FIFO (First In First Out)
- SJF (Shortest Job First)
- STCF (Shortest Time-to-Completion First)
- RR (Round Robin)
- MLFQ (Multi-Level Feedback Queue)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/akyung03/cpu-scheduler.git`
2. Navigate into the project folder: `cd cpu-scheduler`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Features
- Simulate CPU scheduling algorithms.
- Select and run algorithms through a user-friendly interface.
- Generate random processes for simulation.
